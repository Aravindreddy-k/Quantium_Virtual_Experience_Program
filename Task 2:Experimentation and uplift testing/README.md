<h3>Task 2-Experimentation and Uplift testing</h3><br>
Julia has asked us to evaluate the performance of a store trial which was performed in stores 77, 86 and 88.<br>
This can be broken down by:<br>
1. Total sales revenue<br>
2. Total number of customers<br>
3. Average number of transactions per customer<br>
       Create a measure to compare different control stores to each of the trial stores to do this write a function to reduce having to re-do the analysis for each trial store. Consider using Pearson correlations or a metric such as a magnitude distance e.g. 1- (Observed distance – minimum distance)/(Maximum distance – minimum distance) as a measure.<br>
      Once you have selected your control stores, compare each trial and control pair during the trial period. You want to test if total sales are significantly different in the trial period and if so, check if the driver of change is more purchasing customers or more purchases per customers etc.
Main areas of Focus are :<br>
1. Select control stores – Explore data, define metrics, visualize graphs<br>
2. Assessment of the trial – insights/trends by comparing trial stores with control stores<br>
3. Collate findings – summarize and provide recommendations<br>
